		<h1>Health</h1>
		<p>Hello Everyone!&nbsp;
		Today I wanted to talk about how to be healthy and why do we need to do that.&nbsp;
		Health consists of two main factors: <ol><li>Food that we eat</li><li>Life style</li></ol>&nbsp;
		We will talk about both factors. &nbsp;
		Never throughout history Humankind has encountered food that did actually hurt our body. &nbsp;
		In 20th century science invented many chemical ways to imitate God given natural food that actually nurishes our bodies. &nbsp;
		Welcome to the 21st century! &nbsp;
		Things are even worse here.&nbsp; 
		As well as our life style has changed. Instead of working in the gardens and building houses we buy a house, buy a food &nbsp;
		hire people to build our fence etc. Not to mention our life style at work, never has humanity encountered 
		a almost immovable life style in front of a computer, how about our lisure time?
		Watching TV, playing videogames, reading books. 
		I mean it is good to read books, but from the phisical exercises perspective it is not much fun and our body just lacks 
		freedom of movement. How often do we run? I am not talking about cars many of us almost do not walk...
		SO I gathered a little bit of information on how get your body back in shape and how to maintain it with proper exercises every day and 
		even to have a perfect body. With nutrisios food to take in. 
		But my main focus will be on how to lose weight for man. Cause Men, it is our job to be healthy and be able to provide for our family and bring 
		good generations to come forth. 
		To be attractive to women and simply to live longer. All of this will increase your ablity to love, serve, provide for your family and be happy!
		You will not regret this knowledge. 
		I am not a professional doctor, but this practices has prooven to be efective in my life so Lets keep going!
		At least you will know how to lose weight, all other things are up to you.
