		in a css file and we showed the results on the page. It provided visual evidence of the matirial and tuaght in the 
		presentation, also it emphasized importance of applying styling through padding and margin for a web page.
		I used LiveCSSEditor to provide the material on the page.</p>

		<h2>Things as They Really Are, Ensign June 2010<h2>
		<p>"Please be careful of becoming so immersed and engrossed in pixels, texting,
		earbuds, twittering, online social networking, and potentially addictive 
		uses of media and the Internet that you fail to recognize the importance 
		of your physical body and miss the richness of person-to-person communication. 
		Beware of digital displays and data in many forms of computer-mediated interaction 
		that can displace the full range of physical capacity and experience.
		<br>
		Brothers and sisters, please understand. I am not suggesting all technology 
		is inherently bad; it is not. Nor am I saying we should not use its many 
		capabilities in appropriate ways to learn, to communicate, to lift and 
		brighten lives, and to build and strengthen the Church; of course we should. 
		But I am raising a warning voice that we should not squander and damage 
		authentic relationships by obsessing over contrived ones."</p>
