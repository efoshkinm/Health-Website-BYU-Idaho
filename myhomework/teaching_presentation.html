	<section><h2>Margins</h2>
	<h3>What is a Margin?</h3>
	<p>Margin is a CSS property that is responsible for whitespaces in between a border and a page content. For additional information go to the box model below.</p>
	<h3>How to declare a Margin</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>article{padding: 25px(Top) 50px(right) 75px(bottom) 100px(left);}</li>
				<li>article{padding: 25px(Top) 50px(right\left) 75px(bottom);}</li>
				<li>article{padding: 25px(Top\bottom) 50px(right\left);}</li>
				<li>article{padding: 25px(All sides);}</li>
			</ol>
		<p>All the margin properties can have the following values:
			<ul>
				<li>auto - the browser calculates the margin</li>
				<li>length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.</li>
				<li>% - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element</li>
				<li>inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element</li>
			</ul>

	<h3>What is a Padding?</h3>
	<p>Padding is a CSS property that is responsible for whitespaces in between a border and a content inside padding. For additional information go to the box model below.</p>
	<h2> How to declare a Paddings</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>article{padding: 25px(Top) 50px(right) 75px(bottom) 100px(left);}</li>
			<li>article{padding: 25px(Top) 50px(right\left) 75px(bottom);}</li>
			<li>article{padding: 25px(Top\bottom) 50px(right\left);}</li>
			<li>article{padding: 25px(All sides);}</li>
		</ol>
	<p>All the padding properties can have the following values:
		<ul>
			<li>length - specifies a padding in px, pt, cm, etc.</li>
			<li>% - specifies a padding in % of the width of the containing element</li>
			<li>inherit - specifies that the padding should be inherited from the parent element</li>
		</ul>

	<section><h2>Box Model</h2>
	<img alt="box model" src="../images/box_model.gif">
		<ul>
			<li>Content may represent either text or a picture , or any other element</li>
			<li>Border is a visual line that separates content with the “other world”(i.e. other content on the page)</li>
			<li>Padding and Margin make the separete content, border, page contect and therefore make visual difference.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Practice</h2>
	<p>	In the example beloow we can see that content(that is the text) has padding with the color
		of lightblue. Top and bottom have padding of 200px and left and right have padding of 100px.
		We applied the third padding declaretion which is "article{padding: 25px(Top\bottom) 50px(right\left);}".
		<br>The same principle was applied to declare margins. <br>
			Margins are the space between the border(in our case the padding, since we didn't declare border)
		and the other page elements. We can look at the footer or this text. The margins for this element 
		was top and bottom 100px and left and right 200px. We applied the third declaretion method:
		article{padding: 25px(Top\bottom) 50px(right\left);}.

	<section id="practice">
		<p>Elder Russell M. Nelson said, "Now in this day of the Internet, 
		there are new and exciting ways you can do missionary work.
		You can invite friends and neighbors to visit the new mormon.org web site.
		If you have blogs and online social networks, you could link your sites to
		mormon.org. And there you can create your own personal profile. Each profile 
		includes an expression of belief, an experience, and a testimony. Because this is a new 
		feature, most of these profiles are available in English. Profiles in other languages 
		will follow." (Be Thou an Example of the Believers, October 2010 General Conference)</p>
