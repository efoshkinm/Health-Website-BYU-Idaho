			<h2>Peer Review</h2>
			<p>You don't have to be that specific in the purpose statement. It's supposed to be a 30 second elevator pitch. You don't have to include the technology involved. 

I think that the browser windows was supposed to go on its side like a laptop would look, and because it is so much larger than the phone, you can include information that wasn't available on the phone. 

There is some spelling errors and grammar issues. You may want to run a spell check. 

The Validate HTML tool in the Web Developer browser extension found several warnings and errors that need to be addressed and can be seen here.

Some of the warnings had to do with limiting yourself to only one h1 in your project and using h2 for the rest of the headings, using a heading before any article (or just use section instead), and missing an opening p on line 67.<BR>

<p>I think it looks good! Something you could add, for the tablet and browser it just says weather information or general info, so maybe more specific of what info you had in mind. Also some boxes aren't aligned, but other than that it looks good. I think it's cool how you will add temperature conversions.
If you have time I noticed a few spelling errors in other sections so maybe reread it. Good Job! :)<BR>
