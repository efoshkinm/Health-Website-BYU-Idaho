				<p>The main target audience is going to be middle class, middle age people that have a higher education,
				good income, office employees, married people, everybody who needs information. Particularly this website
				is oriented on Russia audience. I used this website a lot.</p>
				<p>
				So, Yandex is a web portal that provides users with meaningfull information related to every aspect of life.<BR>
For example on page 1 you may notice the Search bar, access to Maps, Videos, eStore(Market), Images, Weather. <BR>
Page 2 provides us with good News feed.It is very important for the target audience. News are structured with best practices Typography, Alignment, Proximity and Contrast.<BR>
Page 3 provides Curreancy rates of USD, EUR, RUR. This section is very important, because currience is
changed daily and not only business people need it but also an average person, as well as families.<BR>
Page 4 provides meaningfull links to resources of real estate, car purchase, Job opportunities and usefull Apps for Android.<BR>
Overall the web page provides users with meaningfull information that is necessary  for daily tasks. It is good for families as well as for business.
Mobile version of the web page provides structured presentation of information. It keeps the interest and is very comfortable to use.
Fonts, texture and proximity facilitate understanding of the content. Colors of the page make it enjoyable.

		<h2>Site Contrast.</h2>
		<p>
		As an example of a bad web designed web page I chose <a href="http://irishwrecksonline.net" target="_blank">http://irishwrecksonline.net</a><BR><a href="http://irishwrecksonline.net" target="_blank"><img src="/images/wierdwebpage.bmp"></a>.<BR> 
		By looking at the web page I cannot really understand what was the target audience. So I don't think they made it clear what it was exactly that they wanted to provide.
		The mobile version of the website is the same as a web browser one.
		So web page was made with little effort. So I can't really classify it.
